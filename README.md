# 🧩 Playcode - Gamified Logic Learning Platform

**Playcode** is an interactive educational platform designed to introduce children to programming concepts through gamification. Built during the hackathon **VaultHiest** hosted by CGC, it reached the **3rd evaluation** for its innovative approach to logic building.

## 🎮 How It Works

Instead of writing syntax, kids use **Drag-and-Drop Blocks** to control a robot character. The goal is to solve puzzles (maze navigation) using logic loops and commands.

* **Visual Coding:** Powered by Google's **Blockly** engine.
* **Logic Challenges:** Progressive difficulty levels (Move $\rightarrow$ Loop $\rightarrow$ Conditionals).
* **Immediate Feedback:** Real-time execution of block logic on the canvas.
